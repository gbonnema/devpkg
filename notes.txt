** Remarks **
2. Shell_exec calls Shell_run, but does not check rc == 0. It should.
3. In devpkg.c the option for "d:" is not processed anywhere in the switch statement: what should it have done?
4. In devpkg.c 28, rv is assigned, but not tested: should get a check(rv == 0, "xxx")?
5. In Shell.c we use apr_proc_create which creates a unix process or heavyweight thread. I noticed 
	that apr also has apr_thread_create. Could you elaborate on the criteria when choosing one or the other?
6. Consider making the type: process or thread, optional, with default to process.
7. Execute CLEAN_SH template only at the start, not at the end. Motivation is that you can check out
   what was created in the /tmp/pkg- directory whether there was an error or not. If you clean at start 
   and at end, then no trace is left to check out.
8. Asked Zed whether I could insert a license in my copy of the source.
9. Altered DESTDIR to not contain a leading slash, as the result will be //usr/local/bin
10. How about using bstring throughout the program? TODO
