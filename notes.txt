** Remarks **
1. Pattern is part of commands.h, shell exec parameters are part of shell.h
	a. make pattern to recognize type of command part of shell exec, so all info for 
	exec is in one place.
2. Shell_exec calls Shell_run, but does not check rc == 0. It should.
3. In devpkg.c the option for "d:" is not processed anywhere in the switch statement: what should it have done?
4. In devpkg.c 28, rv is assigned, but not tested: should get a check(rv == 0, "xxx")?
5. In Shell.c we use apr_proc_create which creates a unix process or heavyweight thread. I noticed 
	that apr also has apr_thread_create. Could you elaborate on the criteria when choosing one or the other?
6. Consider making the type: process or thread, optional, with default to process.
7. Execute CLEAN_SH template only at the start, not at the end. Motivation is that you can check out
   what was created in the /tmp/pkg- directory whether there was an error or not. If you clean at start 
   and at end, then no trace is left to check out.
8. Asked Zed whether I could insert a license in my copy of the source.
9. Altered DESTDIR to not contain a leading slash, as the result will be //usr/local/bin
